# ⛔ MANDATORY TOOL RULES

**READ THIS FIRST. VIOLATIONS ARE WORKSPACE POLICY BREACHES.**

---

## File Editing: Mouse Tools ONLY

**PROHIBITED** (never use under any circumstances):

- ❌ `replace_string_in_file`
- ❌ `multi_replace_string_in_file`

**REQUIRED** (use exclusively):

- ✅ `quick_edit` → instant save
- ✅ `batch_quick_edit` → `save_changes`

**No exceptions. No "just this once." No workarounds.**

## Quick Reference

| Task           | Tool                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Single edit    | `quick_edit`                         |
| Multiple edits | `batch_quick_edit` → `save_changes`  |
| New file       | `create_file` (then Mouse for edits) |
| Search first   | `find_in_file`                       |
