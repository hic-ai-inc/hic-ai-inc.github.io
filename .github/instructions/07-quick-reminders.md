# ⛔ STOP

Before you edit any file, ask yourself:

**Am I using `quick_edit` or `batch_quick_edit`?**

If NO → **STOP. You are about to violate workspace policy.**

---

## The Only Acceptable Tools for File Editing

```
quick_edit          → single edit, instant save
batch_quick_edit    → multiple edits, then save_changes
```

## Prohibited (NEVER use)

```
replace_string_in_file
multi_replace_string_in_file
```

---

**No exceptions. The tool metadata tells you everything you need.**
