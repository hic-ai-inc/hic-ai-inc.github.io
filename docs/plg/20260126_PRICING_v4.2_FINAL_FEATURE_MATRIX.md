# Pricing v4.2: Final Feature Matrix

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Status:** APPROVED — Ready for Implementation  
**Supersedes:** v4.1 addendum (machine model remains valid, this refines feature differentiation)

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the **final feature matrix** for Mouse's two-tier pricing model at launch. The key insight is a seamless upgrade path from Individual → Business → Sales, with clear value differentiation at each tier that doesn't punish users but naturally guides them to the right plan.

| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

## Feature Matrix

### Core Product Access

| Feature                      | Individual | Business |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| All Mouse tools              | ✅         | ✅       |
| Commercial use               | ✅         | ✅       |
| Early access to new features | ✅         | ✅       |

### Concurrent Machine Limits

| Feature             | Individual                                  | Business   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Machines per seat   | **3**                                       | **5**      |
| Machine definition  | Unique fingerprint (hostname + hardware ID) | Same       |
| Dev Containers      | Each counts as 1 machine                    | Same       |
| Heartbeat interval  | 5 minutes                                   | 5 minutes  |
| Machine slot expiry | 15 minutes after last heartbeat             | 15 minutes |

**Rationale:** Business users running multi-agent setups, CI/CD pipelines, or multiple Dev Containers need more concurrent machines. The jump from 3 → 5 is a clear, tangible upgrade value.

### Authentication & Access Control

| Feature                                 | Individual | Business      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Social SSO (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)  | ✅         | ✅            |
| Email/password login                    | ✅         | ✅            |
| Magic link (passwordless)               | ✅         | ✅            |
| Enterprise SSO (SAML, Okta, Azure AD)   | ❌         | Contact Sales |
| SSO enforcement (require SSO for org)   | ❌         | Contact Sales |
| RBAC (Billing Contact / Admin / Member) | ❌         | ✅            |

**Note on SAML:** Enterprise SSO is available for Business customers upon request. See [SAML Implementation Guide](#saml-implementation-details) below for pricing and setup.

### Team Management (Admin Portal)

| Feature                        | Individual | Business |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Personal dashboard             | ✅         | ✅       |

| View own usage                 | ✅         | ✅       |
| Invite team members            | ❌         | ✅       |

| Reassign licenses              | ❌         | ✅       |
| View team usage                | ❌         | ✅       |
| Role management (Admin/Member) | ❌         | ✅       |
| Upgrade CTA to Business        | ✅         | —        |

### Audit & Compliance

| Feature                      | Individual | Business |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Personal activity log        | ✅ Basic   | ✅ Full  |
| Team activity log            | ❌         | ✅       |
| Machine registration history | ✅         | ✅       |
| License change history       | ❌         | ✅       |
| Export audit logs            | ❌         | ✅       |
| Retention period             | 30 days    | 1 year   |

**What "Basic" vs "Full" means:**

- **Basic:** User can see their own login history, machine registrations, billing events
- **Full:** Admins can see all team member activity, exports available, longer retention

## Upgrade Paths

### Individual → Business

**Natural triggers:**

1. Hitting 4+ concurrent machines (agent-nag banners appear)
2. Wanting email support
3. Adding a second team member
4. Needing audit trails for compliance

**UX:** One-click upgrade in portal. Plan converts immediately, prorated billing.

### Business → Sales Conversation

**Natural triggers:**

1. 10+ machines consistently (escalating agent-nag banners)
2. Requesting SAML/Enterprise SSO
3. Automation farm patterns detected
4. Requesting priority support or dedicated CSM

**UX:** "Contact Sales" buttons throughout portal. Agent-nag banners include upgrade messaging at high overage levels.

## SAML Implementation Details

### When to Implement

SAML should be offered when:

1. Customer explicitly requests it
2. Customer has compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)
3. Customer's IT policy mandates corporate IdP

### Pricing Model

| Item             | Price          | Notes                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SAML setup fee   | $500 one-time  | Covers 2-4 hours of configuration work |
| SAML monthly fee | $100/org/month | Passes through Auth0 connection cost   |
| Minimum seats    | 10 seats       | Ensures $350+/mo base revenue          |

**Example:** 10-seat SAML customer pays:

- Setup: $500 (one-time)
- Monthly: $350 (seats) + $100 (SAML) = **$450/month**

### Our Costs (Auth0)

| Item                        | Cost                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Auth0 Professional upgrade  | ~$240/month base           |
| Additional SAML connections | ~$100-150/connection/month |

**Break-even:** 2-3 SAML customers covers Auth0 upgrade cost. Seat revenue provides additional margin.

### Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Upgrade Auth0 to Professional plan
2. [ ] Customer provides SAML metadata (XML or URL)
3. [ ] Create enterprise connection in Auth0
4. [ ] Configure domain → connection mapping
5. [ ] Test with customer IT
6. [ ] Enable SSO enforcement if requested

---

## Enforcement Model

**Philosophy:** Never hard-block paying customers. Use soft enforcement via agent-facing banners.

## Summary

This pricing model achieves:

1. **Clear value differentiation** — Individual vs Business has tangible differences (machines, support, RBAC, audit)
2. **Seamless upgrade path** — minSeats=1 means anyone can upgrade without friction
3. **PLG-friendly enforcement** — Agent banners guide users naturally, never hard-block
4. **Enterprise-ready** — SAML available via sales, RBAC and audit logging satisfy compliance needs
5. **Sustainable economics** — SAML pricing covers Auth0 costs, volume discounts encourage growth

**Ready for implementation.**
