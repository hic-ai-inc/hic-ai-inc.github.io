## Rationale for Changes

### 1. "Team" → "Business"

**Problem:** "Team" implies multiple people. A power user buying one seat for themselves feels awkward purchasing a "Team" plan for a team of one.

**Solution:** "Business" tier works for:

- Solo professionals who need more capacity
- Actual teams of any size
- Commercial use emphasis (vs. hobbyist Individual)

### 2. "Sessions" → "Machines"

**Problem:** "Session" was ambiguous:

- Is each VS Code window a session?
- Is each AI agent (Copilot, Q, Claude) a session?
- What happens when I have 5 repos open?

**Solution:** "Machine" is concrete and intuitive:

- One laptop = 1 machine (regardless of repos/windows open)
- One container = 1 machine (each has unique fingerprint)
- One desktop = 1 machine

**Key insight:** Multiple VS Code windows on the same laptop share a single machine identity. The Mouse extension sends heartbeats with a machine fingerprint (hostname + hardware ID), not per-window.

### 3. Limit: 3 Machines (Both Tiers)

**Problem:** Original limit of 2 blocked legitimate Dev Container workflows:

- Frontend repo container
- Backend repo container
- Local development
  = 3 machines for a normal developer

**Solution:** 3 machines covers 95%+ of legitimate workflows while still catching automation farms.

## Updated Pricing Table

| Tier       | Price       | Machines Included     | Target                         |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Individual | $15/mo      | 3 concurrent          | Solo developers, hobbyists     |
| Business   | $35/seat/mo | 3 concurrent per seat | Teams, power users, commercial |

> **Note:** "Concurrent" means machines with heartbeat activity in the last 15 minutes. Close a laptop → its slot auto-releases.

## Machine Counting Examples

| Scenario                            | Machines | Tier Required        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Laptop with 5 VS Code windows       | 1        | Individual           |
| Laptop + desktop                    | 2        | Individual           |
| Laptop + 2 Dev Containers           | 3        | Individual           |
| Laptop + 3 Dev Containers           | 4        | Individual (overage) |
| Team of 3, each on laptop + desktop | 6        | Business (2 seats)   |
| Automation: 50 containers           | 50       | Contact Sales        |

## Heartbeat Mechanism

1. **Activation:** Mouse extension registers machine fingerprint on first tool use
2. **Heartbeat:** Every 5 minutes, Mouse sends `POST /api/license/heartbeat`
3. **Expiry:** Machines with no heartbeat for 15 minutes are marked inactive
4. **Benefit:** No explicit "deactivation" needed — close laptop and slot auto-releases

This means temporary spikes (spinning up test containers) don't permanently consume slots.
