## HIC Platform Vision

**HIC = Humans In Charge**

- **Human Users are in charge** - Policy, approval, ownership, responsibility
- **AI Agents are in command** - Execution, tactical decisions, fully aligned with their Human

**Alignment is the architecture.** Agents operate with autonomy _because_ they are aligned with their Human User. Every Agent action traces back through the Chain of Responsibility to the Human User.

**Business Model:**

- **Free Forever:** Mouse, Notepad, Calculator, DateTime (local tools)
- **Premium:** Agent Identity Stack, persistent Memory, Signatures

See `docs/vision/` for the six platform pillars.
